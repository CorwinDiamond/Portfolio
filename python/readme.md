## Bus Company Schedualing Automation

**Batch.py and Update.py**
I originaly created this script to do part of my job for me, and I did not intend on distributing it. 
It took me about 30 hours to teach myself enough selenium and additional python to get the program working. 
I was not sure if I was going to be able to use python and its extensions to get the program working so, I did not take the time to use good coding style and ediqute.
However, the program saves the Company about 30 man-hours a week, and I have not had the luxury of time to go back and refactor the programs.

**Python Documentation**
This pdf file is the documentation I made for the bus company.
